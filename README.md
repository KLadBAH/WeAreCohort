# Welcome to the Git Space for the Data Science Class of 2016

This repository is a space to introduce ourselves and practice Git. Come give it a try at [AboutUs.md](AboutUs.md)

If you are new to the Git environment, you will need to be familiar with making a pull request to contribute to the AboutUs.md introductions. You can find some help at [this link]( https://github.com/TechTank-DataScience/WeAreCohort/blob/master/git-forking-workflow.md)
